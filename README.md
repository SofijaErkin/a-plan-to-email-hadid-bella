## News Key Words

### 1.One

Hadid previously got candid about her mental health in November when she posted

photos of herself crying. "Social media is not real. For anyone struggling,

please remember that," she wrote.

"Sometimes all you've gotta hear is that you're not alone. So from me to you,

you're not alone. I love you, I see you, and I hear you. Self help and mental

illness/chemical imbalance is not linear and it is almost like a flowing

rollercoaster of obstacles… it has its ups and downs, and side to sides," she

added. "But I want you to know, there is always light at the end of the tunnel,

and the rollercoaster always comes to a complete stop at some point."

Earlier this week, Hadid celebrated Kin arriving on the shelves of Erewhon

Market by posting a photo of herself grocery shopping in style.

"God is Good!!!! Thank you for your support. It means more to us than you know,

"she wrote in the caption.

Bella Hadid shared selfies of herself during her “depressive episodes” back in

November 2021 after watching Willow Smith’s interview on Netflix. She shares an

uplifting message with her 48.4 million followers on Instagram.

She thanked the artist, “It made me feel a little less alone and that’s why I’d

like to post this.”

She quoted her lines and told WSJ, “That post made me less lonely because I had

a lot of people that have reached out saying, ‘I feel that way too.’”

Her purpose “was to make sure that anybody that was feeling that way knew it was

okay to feel that way…Even though on Instagram things look so beautiful, at the

end of the day, we are all cut from the same cloth.”

“I felt like it was just good for me to be able to speak my truth and at some

point, I wasn’t able to post nice pretty pictures anymore. I was over it.”

“I don’t know if that’s not what people want on Instagram, and that’s fine. I

don’t have to be on Instagram forever. I feel like this real is the new real,

and that’s what’s important to me.”

The 25-year-old has been sending her mother, Yolanda, selfies of herself during

her episodes. The half-Palestinian has always been open when it comes to her

life with Lyme disease as well. She shared that those episodes can feel

“excruciating and debilitating” on top of the pain.

“I do have good days. Today is a good day. My brain fog is feeling better, I

don’t feel depressed.”

“I don’t have as much anxiety as I usually do. But tomorrow I could wake up and

be the complete opposite. That’s why I get so overwhelmed.”

She previously ingested 30 pills and self-administered “two shots a day in the

keester” in 2017 due to her battle with Lyme Disease.

But on her latest realization, she finally found it in herself to focus on her

health, “I realize now that my body is a temple.”

“And the routine that we have in the morning, especially Monday mornings, is…

almost the most important thing because if you don’t start your week on a good

note, it’s not going to be good for you.”
